# Home Price Prediction with Linear Regression

This GitHub repository focuses on predicting home prices using simple linear regression in Python. The project uses data from Monroe Township, New Jersey, visualizes it with a scatter plot, and constructs a linear regression model. The Python code, implemented in a Jupyter Notebook, leverages pandas for data manipulation and scikit-learn for regression. The walkthrough covers data loading, plotting, model creation, and training. An example demonstrates predicting home prices for specific areas, and model evaluation involves minimizing errors between predicted and actual data. Model parameters, such as coefficients and intercept, are calculated and applied to predict prices for new data points. The repository also includes an exercise for predicting Canada's adjusted net national income per capita in 2020. For effective learning, coding exercises and video tutorials are recommended.

# Multivariate Regression for Home Price Prediction

This GitHub repository delves into multivariate regression for predicting home prices in Monroe Township, New Jersey. Various metrics, including area, bedrooms, and age, influence home prices, leading to a more complex model compared to simple linear regression. The tutorial covers data analysis, revealing a missing data point and establishing a linear relationship between factors and the target variable (price). The linear regression equation, with coefficients (m1, m2, m3) and an intercept (b), is introduced.

Key topics include handling missing data, building a multivariate regression model in Python, and data preprocessing. The process involves addressing missing values, exemplified by filling missing bedrooms with the median. The tutorial provides an overview of the linear regression model creation process, covering module importation, data loading, and coefficient analysis. Practical applications include predicting salaries in the HR domain based on experience, written test scores, and personal interview scores.

For hands-on learning, the tutorial encourages downloading a provided CSV file for an exercise on building a salary prediction model. The GitHub repository contains tutorials and exercises for further practice. The tutorial concludes with appreciation and a summary of key insights.
